/// https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram
///
/// A histogram tracks the number of observations and the sum of the observed
/// values, allowing to calculate the average of the observed values.
///
/// At its core a histogram has a counter per bucket. The sum of observations
/// also behaves like a counter as long as there are no negative observations.
///
/// See https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/ for detailed
/// explanations of histogram usage and differences to summaries.
///
/// The class is thread-safe. No concurrent call to any API of this type causes
/// a data race.
